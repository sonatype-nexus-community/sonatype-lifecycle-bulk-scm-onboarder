## Engaging with this project

TODO: Add links below to your repo's GitHub Issues and Discussions pages.

Here are some important resources:
- [GitHub Issues](#) - a place for bugs to be raised and feature requests made
- [GitHub Discussions](#) - a place to discuss ideas or real-world usage

## Development Guidelines

*TODO: Explain in detail what development standards must be adhered to when contributions are made.*

*You might include:*
- Testing requirements
- Explanation of PR Checks
- What to expect from a PR reviewer/approver (such as expected time to response)

### Coding Conventions

- In order to help verify the authenticity of contributed code, we ask that your [commits be signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). 
  All commits must be signed off to show that you agree to publish your changes under the current terms and licenses of the project.
  
  Here are some notes we found helpful in configuring a local environment to automatically sign git commits:
    - [GPG commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#gpg-commit-signature-verification)
    - [Telling Git about your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key#telling-git-about-your-gpg-key)
    
- TODO: Explain code style, convention & quality standards (and any associated checks that will be run)

## Testing

*TODO: Explain in detail:*

- How to run tests, including dependencies that might need installing or configuring
- Environmental configuration that may be required
- Consideration when writing tests (i.e. don't depend on *X*)

*You might wish to break this out into different sub-sections if you have, for example, unit tests and integration tests with differing requirements.*
